Command message status
======================

Naive here means that the function call works for a specific case but doesn't
cover the complete implementation. This may mean that "Remaining length"
headers are limited to 127 bytes, forms of QoS>0 aren't properly supported,
persistant data isn't stored or some other limitation.

Note that "complete" doesn't mean everything is finished - it just means
complete functionality. When a function does error handling and checks input
then mark it as "safe".
